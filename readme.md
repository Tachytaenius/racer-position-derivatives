# Racer Position Derivatives

Goal: maths for a racing game in which your acceleration drop as you push max speed, but is 100% if you are moving against your velocity.

Red graph is acceleration, green graph is velocity, and blue graph is position.
Grey lines are +/- max speed and the white line is the x axis.

You start moving backwards faster than your max speed, trying to move forwards. Acceleration is at max.
As you start to move forwards and keep pushing that movement, your acceleration drops until eventually you reach max speed, where acceleration hits zero.
